      <p>For this tutorial, we will be recreating an already live component known as <a href="https://design.tax.service.gov.uk/hmrc-design-patterns/currency-input/">Currency Input</a>. This component gives context to the user that the number they will be typing in is a monetary amount, ensuring they are aware in the case that they will be paying for something online. This is how Currency Input looks:</p>

      <p>To start this tutorial, we will first need to set up our work environment, creating some folders and files that we can work in.</p>
      <br>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Open your terminal, and navigate to the hmrc-frontend GitHub repository that we cloned earlier. You can do this with the <em>cd</em> terminal command.</li>
        <li>Next, create a branch of hmrc-frontend. This is a version of the repository that you can make changes to and it will not affect the main version. You should give this a suitable name, such as <em>'yourname-placement-tutorial'</em>. The following command may help:</li>
        {{
          codeSnippet({
            code: 'git checkout -b yourname-placement-tutorial'
          })
        }}
        <li>This will create the branch with that name, and automatically move you on to it. Now we can type the following command to open our workspace.</li>
                {{
          codeSnippet({
            code: 'code .'
          })
        }}
        <li>Navigate to src/components. You will see there is a folder for each component inside hmrc-frontend. You should create your own with a name like <em>'tutorial-component'</em>.</li>
        <li>We can make the files in this folder that will make up our component. For each of the following file names, right click your new folder and create a file:</li>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>template.test.js</li>
            <li>tutorial-component.yaml</li>
            <li>template.njk</li>
            <li>macro.njk</li>
            <li>_tutorial-component.scss</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>

      <p>This is all the set up we will need. In the next section, we can move on to creating our component, beginning with writing some tests to cover all aspects of Currency Input.</p>
